The difference between UTF-8 and ASCII encoding is the way characters are represented
in binary form.


If we read a file with Polish letters in UTF-8 format without changing the way the data
is formatted, we will get the correct Polish letters, because UTF-8 supports encoding
non-ASCII characters, such as Polish letters.


In the case of ASCII, which does not contain characters outside the ASCII
range, Polish letters may be incorrectly interpreted or replaced with other characters
or special sequences because they are not supported by this encoding.
